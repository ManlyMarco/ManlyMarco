Just a friendly code monkey with a taste for NSFW games.

üî® _What do I work on:_ I'm creating mods for Unity engine games, mostly games by Ill(usion|games). So far I've created more plugins than I can remember, [HF Patches](https://gist.github.com/ManlyMarco/31b78470b8e190686c7ed9686c237e3f) for multiple games (easy to use automatic game updaters and mod installers), KKManager mod manager, and more. I'm also helping with group plugin and mod projects together with other modders in the community.

üì´ _How to reach me:_ If you need to get help with my mods (and the game itself), check the mod's GitHub repository for past issues and create your own; or ask for help on the [Koikatsu!](https://discord.gg/hevygx6) and [Illusion Soft](https://discord.gg/illusionsoft) discord servers (I'm on both of those). If you need help with a mod for a game not made by Illusion, you can still drop by the Koikatsu server or just DM me on Discord (manlymarco) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/manlymarco).

‚ö†Ô∏è _If you're a modder:_ I'm currently hosting a bounty program for bugfixes and improvements to all of [my repositories](https://github.com/ManlyMarco?tab=repositories) and repositories under [IllusionMods](https://github.com/IllusionMods). For details, either check pins in the #mod-programming channel on the Koikatsu discord server, or DM me.
